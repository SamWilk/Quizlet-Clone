# Quizlet-Clone
Making a Quizlet-Clone just to help me practice working with APIs, Postgres, and also to study my classes!

I am using Next Js for the frame work of this project, with a simple db structure with just tables for (cards, card sets, and folders that will hold multiple card sets).

All commands will be through HTTPS commands, and will allow a end user to create, read, update, and delete cards, sets, or folders alike.
